## Introduction

This project showcases a simple signal generation application using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The generated signal consists of a sinusoidal waveform with a frequency of 2 Hz, and it includes an added noise component with a frequency of 100 Hz. This emulates a signal generator. It is names 'master' since it is the master device in the SPI connection. the slave is in the repository (https://github.com/your-username/pico-slave.git)

## Requirements

To build and run this project, you'll need:
